# Designing and Debugging

## Rules for If-Statements

1. Every _if_ statement must have an else.
2. If the else should never run, use a die() function in the else that prints an error message.
3. No more that 2 deep
4. Keep Boolean tests simple. If they need to be complex, make the calculations variables.
5. Use white space for _if_ statements before and after.

## Rules for Loops

* Choose _for_ loops over _while_ 

## Tips for Debugging

* Use print statements to keep track of variable points
* Code a bit, test, code a bit, test. Write in small bits.
