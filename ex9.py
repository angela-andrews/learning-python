# printing 

#  Here's some new strange stuff, remember type it exactly.

# print the string on the same line
days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"
# print Jan on the same line as and the remaining months on new lines
months = "Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"

print("Here are the days: ", days)
print("Here are the months: ", months)
# this allows you to break your string up over multiple lines.
print("""
There's something going on here.
With the the three double-quotes.
We'll be able to type as much as we like.
Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.
