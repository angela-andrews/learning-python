# Boolean Practice

Guess what each answer will be, then run each problem in the REPL to confirm it.

1. True and True 
2. False and True
3. 1 == 1 and 2 == 1 
4. "test" == test
5. 1 == 1 or 2 != 1
6. True and 1 == 1
7. False and 0 != 1
8. True or 1 == 1
9. "test" == "testing"
10. 1 != 0 and 2 == 1
11. "test" != "testing"
12. "test" == 1
13. not (True and False)
14. not (1 == 1 and 0 != 1)
15. not (10 == 1 or 1000 == 1000)
16. not (1 != 10 or 3 == 4)
17. not ("testing" == "testing" and "Zed" == "Cool Guy")
18. 1 == 1 and (not ("testing == 1 or 1 == 0))
19. "chunky" == "bacon" and (not (3 == 4 or 3 == 3))
20. 3 == 3 and (not ("testing" == "testing" or "Python" == "Fun"))
