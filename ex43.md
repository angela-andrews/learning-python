# Basis Object-Oriented Analysis and Design

## Top Down
The process

1. Write or draw about the problem
2. Extract key concepts from 1 and research them.
* Make a list of all the nouns and verbs in yur writings and drawings, then write out how they are related.
* Research any concepts you don't understand.
3. Create a class hierarcy and object map for the concepts.
* Create an outline/tree of the concepts and how they are related as classes.
* * Take a list of your nouns and start asking "Is this one like the other concepts nouns?
* Take the verbs you have and see if those are function names for each class put them in your tree.
4. Code the classes and a test to run them.
* Copy and paste the tre into a file and then edit it into classes.
5. Repeat and refine.


## Bottom-Up
1. Take a small piece o the problem; hack on some code and get it to run barely.
2. Refine the code into something more formal with classess and automated tests.
3. Extract the key concepts you're using and try to find research for them.
4. Write a description of what's really going on.
5. Go back and refine the code, possibly throwing it out and starting over.
6. Repeat, moving on to some other piece of the problem.
